            I'm passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects
            of digital products to life. User experience, beautiful pixels and
            writing clean accessible, human code matters to me. I sweat the
            details. And as a follower of John Maedaâ€™s Laws Of Simplicity, I
            agree that less is more.
